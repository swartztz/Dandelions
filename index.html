        <p>
            Welcome children of the Spring,<br>
            In your garbs of green and gold,<br>
            Lifting up your sun-crowned heads<br>
            On the verdant plain and wold.<br>
            <br>
            As a bright and joyous troop<br>
            From the breast of earth ye came<br>
            Fair and lovely are your cheeks,<br>
            With sun-kisses all aflame.<br>
            <br>
            In the dusty streets and lanes,<br>
            Where the lowly children play,<br>
            There as gentle friends ye smile,<br>
            Making brighter life's highway<br>
            <br>
            Dewdrops and the morning sun,<br>
            Weave your garments fair and bright,<br>
            And we welcome you to-day<br>
            As the children of the light.<br>
            <br>
            Children of the earth and sun.<br>
            We are slow to understand<br>
            All the richness of the gifts<br>
            Flowing from our Father's hand.<br>
        </p>
